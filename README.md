# NCAAMensBasketball
This is a personal project in which I looked at how home court advantage has (or hasn't) changed during the COVID-19 pandemic-affected Men's NCAA basketball seasons of 2020-21 and 2021-22, during which fans were not allowed to attend games (or with limited capacity for part of the 2021-22 season). I also trained a machine learning model to predict my march madness bracket. The directory is structured as follows:

- `code`: Two Jupyter notebooks containing all of the code for the analysis
    - `HomeCourtAdvantage.ipynb`: Quantifies home court advantage, examines how it changed during the pandemic-affected seasons, and looks at trends over time.
    - `MarchMadnessBracket.ipynb`: Explores Kaggle data set, model and feature selection, final bracket prediction.
- `writeup`: LaTeX source files and [compiled PDF](https://github.com/peterrwi/NCAAMensBasketball/blob/main/writeup/summary.pdf) describing the analysis.
- `files`: Additional files (currently only 1!)
    - `homecourtadvantage.html`: Interactive Bokeh plot showing home court advantage over time. Can be downloaded and opened locally, or it can be accessed online [here](https://astro.ucla.edu/~pwilliams/bokeh/homecourtadvantage.html)
